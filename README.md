# San Francisco Fire Calls & Covid
## Overview

This project involves the analysis of datasets related to fire department calls and COVID testing in the San Francisco area.
Using Hadoop, Oracle, and a Linux server, we queried and cleaned the data via MapReduce and created visualizations to explore potential
correlations between fire department calls and COVID testing data. The goal is to derive insights that can contribute to enhancing
emergency response programs in the San Francisco region.
